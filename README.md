# lab11, 12, 13, and 14 - Odd Duck Products

In this project we're creating a survey for a product company that wants its employees to vote for their favorite items. The user gets 25 choices to choose their favorite products as they render on to the screen in groups of 3. Everytime the user clicks on the picture of the product they like best out of the group, they're instantly prompted with another set of 3, some items recurring throughout the 25 rounds they get.

After the 25 rounds are complete, a chart renders with the collected data on how many times a picture was liked and how many times it was viewed. The data is then stored so it can continue to keep count for more votes on the products in the future.

This project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

Chart.js is the JavaScript library being used to implement the chart UI.

This project is split into 3 tasks/labs.

So far I collaborated with:
* [Miranda Lu](https://github.com/mirandalu2020) - Assisted with debugging
* [Arturo Valadez](https://github.com/Arturovaladez1) - Assisted with storage functionality
* [Michael Dulin](https://github.com/MichaelDulin) - Assisted with CSS

I plan on improving the UI of the entire page with react.js in the near future and creating a more pleasing aesthetic to the entire page by improving the color scheme and adobe fonts.
